Assignment 2 | Avanced Web Design
Phone Fix Booking System

This 'Phone Fix Booking System' HTML Application can process customer (regular consumer or business consumer) requests, via a form, to get their devices fixed. The form has full validation and once a user submits a valid form, it produces an invoice. There is a FAQ page, gathered via JSON request from an uploaded file. There are also some 'advanced' Javascript functions located in the 'Extension' tab. 

The purpose of the assignment was to explore more 'advanced' web technologies including form validation & updating, processing JSON requests and Javascript functionality such as drag and drop, text search and interactive maps.

Design is based off of an assigned template.
